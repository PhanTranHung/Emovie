 <div>The problem occurs when your custom class has for property some other class e.g. "Bitmap". What I made is to change the property field from "private Bitmap photo" to "private transient Bitmap photo". However the image is empty after I getIntent() in the receiver activity. Because of this I passed the custom class to the intent and also I've created a byte array from the image and pass it separatly to the intent:

selectedItem is my custom object and getPlacePhoto is his method to get image. I've already set it before and now I just get it first than convert it and pass it separatly:</div>
